\title{Cullen and Frey Plot for Empirical Distribution Diagnostics}
\usage{
ggdescdist(
  data,
  discrete = FALSE,
  boot = NULL,
  method = "unbiased",
  plot = TRUE,
  print = TRUE,
  color_empirical = "#e15759",
  shape_empirical = 16,
  color_bootstrap = "#4e79a7",
  shape_bootstrap = 1,
  themeless = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric vector.}

\item{discrete}{logical. If `TRUE`, the distribution is considered as discrete.}

\item{boot}{integer. If not `NULL`, boot values of skewness and kurtosis are plotted from bootstrap samples of data.
`boot` must be fixed in this case to an integer above 10.}

\item{method}{character. `"unbiased"` for unbiased estimated values of statistics or `"sample"` for sample values.}

\item{plot}{logical (default: `TRUE`). If `FALSE`, the skewness-kurtosis plot is not plotted.}

\item{print}{logical (default: `TRUE`). If `FALSE`, the descriptive parameters computed are not printed.}

\item{color_empirical}{character. Color used for the empirical (observed) data point on the skewness-kurtosis plot.}

\item{shape_empirical}{integer. Plotting character used for the empirical (observed) point on the skewness-kurtosis plot.}

\item{color_bootstrap}{character. Color used for bootstrap samples on the skewness-kurtosis plot if `boot = TRUE`.}

\item{shape_bootstrap}{integer. Plotting character used for bootstrap samples on the skewness-kurtosis plot if `boot = TRUE`.}

\item{themeless}{logical (default: `FALSE`). Default to `ggplot2` theme, omitting custom theme elements.}
}
\value{
For `print = TRUE`, a list with 7 components (min, max, median, mean, sd, skewness, kurtosis, method), and/or
 for `plot = TRUE`, a skewness-kurtosis plot as `ggplot2` object.
}
\description{
This function prints summary statistics and produces a Cullen and Frey skewness-kurtosis plot to assess the
shape of an empirical distribution via skewness and kurtosis. The code is based on `descdist` from the `fitdistrplus`
package (Delignette-Muller and Dutang, 2015), but the output is a `ggplot2` object.
}
\details{
This function was based on code from `fitdistrplus` v1.2-1 (as of 2024-08-29). Please cite `fitdistrplus` if
using this function; see `citation("fitdistrplus")` (`fitdistrplus` must be installed). The original code was
optimized via ChatGPT by OpenAI and then manually configured to use `ggplot2` for the skewness-kurtosis plot.

Summary statistics include the minimum, maximum, median, mean, sample standard
deviation, and either sample-based or (by default) unbiased estimates of
skewness and Pearsonâ€™s kurtosis (Sokal and Rohlf, 1995).

The Cullen and Frey skewness-kurtosis plot (Cullen and Frey, 1999) displays the empirical skewness
and kurtosis, along with reference values for common theoretical distributions,
helping guide the choice of candidate distributions for fitting.

- **Point representations**: Distributions with fixed skewness and kurtosis values
  (e.g., normal [0, 3], uniform, logistic, exponential) appear as single points.
- **Line representations**: Distributions with shape-dependent values (e.g., gamma,
  lognormal) are shown as curves.
- **Area representations**: Flexible distributions (e.g., beta) appear as regions.
- **Note on Weibull**: Not plotted directly but noted in the legend as overlapping
  with gamma and lognormal shapes.

To show uncertainty in the skewness and kurtosis estimates, set `boot` to an
integer greater than 10 to enable bootstrap resampling. Bootstrap estimates will
appear on the plot and added to the legend.

If `discrete = TRUE`, the plot includes Poisson, negative binomial, and normal
(as a limiting distribution). If `discrete = FALSE`, it includes uniform, normal,
logistic, lognormal, beta, and gamma distributions.
